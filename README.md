# JobTrace: A Chrome Extension for Tracking All Your Job Applications

JobTrace is an extension for Google Chrome that detects when you are applying for a job. JobTrace will automatically create and link itself to a Google Spreadsheet, where it will push information it collects about a certain job that the user is applying to. Some of the fields it collects are the Company Name, Job Title, Job URL, and more. 

This TypeScript-based project was built using React for the extension frontend and content scripts, and server-side JavaScript for the service workers. It was compiled with Webpack and Babel.
